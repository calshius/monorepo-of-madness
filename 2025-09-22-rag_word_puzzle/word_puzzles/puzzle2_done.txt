The committee’s report sprawled across dozens of pages, weaving together testimonies, statistical appendices, and interpretive commentary that often contradicted itself. Readers attempting to follow the argument found themselves circling back repeatedly, as if the narrative were designed to resist linear comprehension. Each paragraph layered qualification upon qualification, embedding subtle shifts in emphasis that blurred the line between conclusion and speculation. The density of phrasing, compounded by archaic terminology and recursive references, created a texture of near impenetrability. Yet within the folds of this elaborate construction, attentive eyes may notice a sequence that appears ordinary at first glance but carries a finality of its own, tucked quietly inside a longer word whose surface meaning distracts from the concealed clarity: overdone.
