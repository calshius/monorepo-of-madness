Archivists catalogued overlapping accounts, building cross-referenced chronologies that braid minor incidents into larger narratives with shifting emphasis on causality. Readers, tracking revisions, found clauses stacking within clauses, with qualifiers and caveats that blur intent and invite slow, exacting scrutiny of structure over subject. Interpretation drifted via footnotes, addenda, and indices, pushing focus toward apparatus rather than core argument, while definitions slid across contexts and resisted final closure. Attention oscillated, circling, backtracking, and pausing amid nested parentheticals that diffuse certainty and sustain inquiry beyond any neat resolution. At a turning point, a single token appears ordinary yet signals conclusion, tucked inside a longer word that distracts by grandeur: supreme.
