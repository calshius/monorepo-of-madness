Researchers assembled overlapping accounts into a composite chronology, interleaving testimonies with cross-referenced errata that reclassified key moments and reframed minor episodes as catalytic. Editorial apparatus expanded in parallel—glosses nested within footnotes, addenda superseding abstracts—until the narrative’s scaffolding occluded its subject, inviting readers to parse structure rather than substance. Methodological caveats proliferated: provisional definitions challenged stable categories, while recursive annotations transformed evidence into an index of interpretive habits rather than a ledger of events. The resulting discourse, saturated with qualified assertions and contingent premises, modulated certainty into gradients that resisted closure, urging patience and exacting attention. At the threshold of a conclusion that refuses finality, the texture condenses into a single term that seems innocuous but encapsulates the atmosphere of the whole: confounding.
