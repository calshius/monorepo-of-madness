# Monorepo of Madness!!

![space-madness](planet-explosion.png)

This repository is a monorepo for daily coding ideas and experiments.  
Each subfolder in the root is named using the format `yyyy-mm-dd-idea_of_the_day`, where:

- `yyyy-mm-dd` is the date the idea was created
- `idea_of_the_day` is a short description of the day's idea (spaces replaced with underscores)

Each folder contains code, documentation, or examples related to that day's idea.  
The goal is to capture and implement a new coding concept, tool, or experiment each day, making this repo a growing collection of practical code examples and creative explorations.

Feel free to browse the folders to see a variety of ideas.
